Generic workspace setup for engineers at Tenet.

Secrets have been ommited and scripts use generic profile names. Change as necessary for your local setup.

run `installs/install.sh` to add all system updates and development tooling.

`aws` directory should be copied and set up at `~/.aws`

files in `zsh` should be individually copied to home directory and used with Oh My ZSH. Amend zsh_aliases to whatever you like for you local dev setup.

`visual_studio_config.json` should be amended according to personal preference and loaded into the preferences section of Visual Studio Code after installs run.
